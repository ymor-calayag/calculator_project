# Simple Calculator

This calculator allows users to perform continuous calculations, choosing to either continue operating on the current result or start a new calculation from scratch. It features a clear text-based interface displaying the current operations and results.

**Technologies Used**

+ ```Python```
+ Modular functions for arithmetic operations
+ Dictionary to map operators to functions

**Features**

+ Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
+ Continuous calculations with previous results
+ Ability to start a fresh calculation anytime
+ Displays calculation steps in an easy-to-read format

**What Users Can Do**

+ Input two numbers and an operator
+ See the calculation result and the full expression
+ Choose to continue calculating with the current result or start a new calculation

**The Process / How It’s Built**

+ Arithmetic operations are implemented as separate functions.
+ A dictionary maps operator symbols to their corresponding functions.
+ The program takes the first number, then loops to perform calculations continuously, updating the current result.
+ The user decides whether to continue calculations or restart.
+ The program displays both the operation performed and the current result clearly.
